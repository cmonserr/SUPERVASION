Knowledge Acquisition by Abduction for Skills Monitoring: Application to Surgical Skills

In this GitHub entry, we present some features related to the work sent to the ILP congress (26th International Conference on Inductive Logic Programming) that holds in London in September of 2016. This entry shows some of the experiments not included in the paper because of the lack of space. Besides, we have included the Narrative used in the experiments as well as the code in XHAIL used for the experiments.
